=============

Here are two different main functions.
If you don't know how to select wich one is executed you can follow this explanation from microsoft : https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/x3eht538.aspx  
 
Program
----------------------
Main program to run the coevolutionary algorithm

This algorithm evolves three populations (features, parameters and instances) in order to find the best combination of individuals.
A log file is created and information are added after each round, so you can use the saved information without finishing the algorithm.

Program2
----------------------------
This second program permits you to run a validation using specific individuals saved into XML files.
